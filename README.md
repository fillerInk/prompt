# prompt
Writing prompts from r/WritingPrompts on an interactive webapp


### How to run prompts locally?

* Once you have cloned the repo, use the [Deta CLI](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/micros/getting_started) to create a new Deta Micro

* Follow the instructions in the docs and run ```deta new``` after logging in with the CLI

* Copy the project files into the directory you just created

* Run ```npm start``` from the directory and the site will be live at localhost:3000

* Once you've made any changes to the site, you can deploy it with Deta using ```deta deploy``` from within the directory containing the .deta file
